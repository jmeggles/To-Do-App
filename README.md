  ## Motivation
 Intriqued by the many ways to approach building a React app, I am researching and actively building as many projects as I can to keep learning.  This is one of many and will be updating as I learn more.

  ## Installation  
No install necessary to view/use the app. Follow this [link](https://todo-app-with-mern.herokuapp.com/).  However, to install, clone repo and `npm i` which will concurrently add the `node_modules` to both the frontend and the backend.  Then `npm start` to run application locally.  Uses port 3001. 

  ## How_to_use
After install or following this [link](https://todo-app-with-mern.herokuapp.com/), the page will load with the current to-dos.  Click on *Create New To-Do* to start a new task.  To view all to-dos, click on *View To-Do List*. To complete a task, from the *View To-Do List* page, click *Edit* and simply write over the task with a new one or lick the *Completed* box to keep that task in view.  

  ## Benefit
 The app helps keep responsibilites in order.  Anyone can utilize this app for school, work, or home activities. 

 ## Future_Add_Ons
 I will add a sorting option and physical delete buttons in future updates. As I use the app more, I will add additional updates.

  ## Tests
Postman was successffully used to ensure the database was receiving all *Get*, *Post*, and *Update* requests. Travis CI also used to verify build success.
